## Projects
- Research on the basic theory and key technologies of cloud-based Web AR services based on 5G cloud-edge-device collaboration

  - Abstract: This project focuses on cloud-based Web SLAM with efficient cloud-edge collaboration based on 5G, Web-oriented cloud-edge-assisted 3D target recognition and scene perception, and on-demand loading and dynamic rendering of large scene models.
  - Duty: Mainly responsible for exploring a fundamental and flexible pose estimation framework, running on the common web platform, and providing the core capability to enable true Web AR; exploring an end-to-end loosely coupled visual-inertial odometry based on deep neural networks to solve pose estimation in ubiquitous mobile AR for heterogeneous devices.


- Winter Olympics Smart Venue Construction—Research on Lightweight AR/VR Applications
  - Abstract: An entire WebAR system which provided users a markerless AR experience and was experienced in Beijing
2022 Winter Olympics. The system can be smoothly run on the majority of smartphones with a perfect balance of data communication and heavy computation.
  - Duty: Mainly responsible for designing an architecture of pose estimation with a single-thread Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) algorithm to avoid the sophisticated multi-threading management to adapt to different browsers and further improve the efficiency. 

- Design of panoramic roaming operation and maintenance visualization system based on Web VR
  - Abstract: This project proposes and implements industrial Internet digital twin visualization based on immersive Web panoramic VR, including real-time dynamic display technology based on image modeling and rendering, combining digital twins with three-dimensional panoramic technology to integrate the digital world with the real world. Integration integrates various security management and monitoring-related information into the three-dimensional panoramic interactive display system in real-time to achieve unified asset security operation and maintenance management.
  - Duty: Mainly responsible for developing a speed skating hall navigation introduction system based on Web AR three-dimensional panorama (speed skating hall venue introduction, ice and snow sports knowledge, sports equipment, sports actions, etc.) and a graphic and text information display system for Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications enrollment promotion.
